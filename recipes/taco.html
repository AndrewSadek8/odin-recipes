            <li>Preheat your grill to 400 degrees fahrenheit</li>

            <li>Remove the skirt steak after reaching the desired temperature and let it sit for at least 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Now lets work on setting up the taco the right way</li>
            <li>If you are using soft tacos then on medium heat add your tacos on the grill</li>
            <li>Make sure to flip the taco every 30 seconds to avoid burning the tortilla</li>
            <li>Cut the skirt steak into strips (make sure to go against the grain)</li>
